\title{Tests results of puck v\puckVersion}
\author{Lo√Øc Girault}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

Bugs: 
\begin{itemize}
\item when changing folder with the workspace button the graph.dot file path does not seems to change
\item in composite example with decouple strict, need to start twice the solving process to remove all violations
\end{itemize}

Tests sources folders root  is \texttt{<scala puck dir>/test/distrib}

\section*{Prototype}
\noindent\begin{tabular}{ l p{12cm} }
\textbf{Sources folder} &  \texttt{prototype/actors}\\
\textbf{Violations detected} &  8\\
\textbf{Violations removed} & yes \\
\textbf{Code produced compiles} & no \\
\textbf{Behavior preserved} & N/A\\
\textbf{Design satisfying} & yes\\
\textbf{Notes} & \\
\end{tabular}
\begin{itemize}
\item Compilation fails because parameterized type of PrototypeDemo.roles was not changed
\item Design is satisfying because the prototype pattern emerge
\item The prototype super type abstraction could/should be merged with the Actor interface
\item When the prototype classes are moved in the newly created package because Actor and PrototypeDemo are in the same file they are also moved : the source produced do not conform to the produced graph.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Bridge}
\noindent\begin{tabular}{ l p{12cm} }
\textbf{Sources folder} &  \texttt{bridge/hanneman\_inspired}\\
\textbf{Violations detected} & 8\\
\textbf{Violations removed} & yes\\
\textbf{Code produced compiles} & no\\
\textbf{Behavior preserved} & N/A\\
\textbf{Design satisfying} & no\\
\textbf{Notes} & \\
\end{tabular}

\begin{itemize}
\item Compilation fails because visibility of printGraphic and printText methods are not adjusted to public while they are exposed in an interface.
\item Design is not satisfying because printGraphic and printText signatures should be merged in one ``print'' signature (and the method thus placed in two separated classes)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Composite}
\noindent\begin{tabular}{ l p{12cm} }
\textbf{Sources folder} &  \texttt{composite}\\
\textbf{Constraint file} & \texttt{decouple\_strict.pl} \\
\textbf{Violations detected} & 9\\
\textbf{Violations removed} & yes but need to start twice the solving process\\
\textbf{Code produced compiles} & no\\
\textbf{Behavior preserved} & N/A\\
\textbf{Design satisfying} & no\\
\textbf{Notes} & \\
\end{tabular}

\begin{itemize}
\item Compilation fails because parameterized type are not changed
\item Design is not satisfying because the two introduced interfaces should be merged
\end{itemize}


\section*{Decorator}
\noindent\begin{tabular}{ l p{12cm} }
\textbf{Sources folder} &  \texttt{decorator/shrinked}\\
\textbf{Notes} & \\
\end{tabular}

\begin{itemize}
\item Error launched while building the graph : no primary user for ``super'' qualifier
\end{itemize}
